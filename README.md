# Flutter-app-Built-using-sonnet-3.5
Ever since Claude sonnet 3.5 released i have been perfecting the art of prompting to build an entire app, below is the video of the app i built using free version of Claude and a pdf filled with my design but in words
How I did it. i first Designed the UI of the app in figma then i got the color codes, dimensions, and names of the icons used in the designs i then proceeded to write all that information down using Google docs i then exported the information in a pdf file format in the pdf the first like was Create a detailed flutter code for the ui image uploaded. Make it very detailed in one or separated files and just give the dart files
The pdf was coupled with the UI Images that i had designed and exported using figma. Am really amazed at what this tool can do and it’s only gonna get better from here which i can’t wait to see
